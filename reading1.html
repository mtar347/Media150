   <div id="yellowblock"><p>After reading chapter 1 of <a href="https://brightspace.cuny.edu/d2l/le/content/1128572/viewContent/39561988/View">Susan-Sonta "In Plato's Cave"</a>, I have wondered how to be a part of making images or "pictures" of this world.
         The examples in the reading helped me understand that a "picture" or any type of image can control the world in so many ways to the point that it can be seen as a powerful tool or a way to save lives.
           When it comes to my contribution to making images, I would want the images I make to allow the consumer to feel a sense of joy and connection to the beauty of the world. 
            The images and graphics I will make I would want to promote nostalgic feeling combined with the sense of expanding the imagination of the consumer.
              The power of how an image can reveal the truth of the world in just one moment gives the sense of importance when creating images, the number of emotions a picture of war can make to people can inspire someone to follow an ideology and build pride in it.
               The graphics and images I would make would mainly focus on my connections with my life experiences and the feelings I have about them to allow them to be represented in my art.
                To be able to make images and graphics comes with a sense of responsibility and ethics that follows it. When the people saw the photos of the Nazi concentration camp the horror of the world look so much clearer and the people’s expression towards it was filled with dread and awareness.
                 That feeling is just an example of how images affect the world’s perspective of events. The images of the world are just the shots of history no matter what subject it will be.
                  The art we create now can have a large impact on our society and how it was perceived in the eyes of the artist. 
                  Depending on who the artist is, it can show emotional connection to events around them and their understanding of it and can influence the consumer to join them or even provoke them to decide the fate of a person’s life.
                   When it comes to the truth behind photographs, that is where I could never question if it was a real event captured or an altered planned event that someone prepped to show people to influence the masses to believe in the agenda, they want people to believe.
                    The world wouldn’t be able to exist without the use of pictures helping us find the history that we weren’t able to experience ourselves. With the use of code and AI the “picture” becomes a lot less clear and can be seen differently than the truth.
                     I know with the use of the tools we have today, I could make my images and graphics easier and have more freedom by setting them up to express my emotions with them and influence the consumer to see the world on how I want to see it.
                      Given the freedom and creativity that is given to me, I know that the art I use to express myself will have the potential to influence others. </p></div>
