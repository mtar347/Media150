    <p>hey, hello, ola, Previet</p>
    <p><b>Creative Statement</b></p>
    <p>Hello, my name is Michael Tarkovsky, a media studies major with aminor in computer science. My goal in life is to make a video game or app that gets me a million dollars and create a production company that allows me to succeed in a creative way. My background is 5 years in the military, and 5 years perfecting my technical skills to have a base of information but it is time to go in a creative path and see what I can do.
    </p>
    <p>I am inspired by the games of my childhood and the games of today. I have created 2 games that focused on redefining phrases and a game that only involves gambling to win the game. I want my games to give the feeling of joy and a lasting feeling of entertainment even after the game is over. Using my technical background and my creativity, I want to be a big name like Nintendo or Sony. The life I lead and the mistakes I made have only made me the person I am today. I can only become better than I was yesterday.   </p>
