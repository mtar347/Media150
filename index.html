    <p>hey, hello, ola, Previet</p>
    <p><b>Creative Statement</b></p>
    <p>Hello, my name is Michael Tarkovsky,
     a media studies major with aminor in computer science.
     My goal in life is to make a video game or app that gets
     me a million dollars and create a production company that
     allows me to succeed in a creative way. My background is 5
     years in the military, and 5 years perfecting my technical
     skills to have a base of information but it is time to go 
     n a creative path and see what I can do.
    </p>
    <p>I am inspired by the games of my childhood and the games 
    of today. I have created 2 games that focused on redefining 
    phrases and a game that only involves gambling to win the game. 
    I want my games to give the feeling of joy and a lasting feeling 
    of entertainment even after the game is over. Using my technical 
    background and my creativity, I want to be a big name like Nintendo 
    or Sony. The life I lead and the mistakes I made have only made me 
    the person I am today. I can only become better than I was yesterday.   </p>
