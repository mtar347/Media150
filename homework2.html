                For the first image I saw the fire prevention equipments on the stairs and thought on how to exaggerate the enviroment and place a pool like texture on the pipe and fire prevention equipment to stand out.
                The hue focus was fire or orange, red, yellow and with a high saturation to connect the heat.
                For the second image I took the stairs and made it into a 5:7 ratio and thought with the use of a window from my bedroom to replace the spaces in between each step to represent the cold feeling of going through life.
                Then used a sunset on a beach image to replace the close door to represent the want for warmth while dealing with the cold.
