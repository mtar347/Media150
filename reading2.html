   <div id="yellowblock"><p>After reading <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/21/ai-slop-artificial-intelligence-social-media">The Guardian's</a> article about Ai Slop and I find it to be a bother-some trend that will cause issues when it comes to understanding the truth of the world and it's events.
The idea that this tool is used to make disgusting themed images and videos shows how this is just history being recycled again.
With the use of propaganda, the images of many groups of people were seen in many negative stereotypical and this caused people to believe the lies but with thei Ai slop this makes the process fast and easier for them to keep recreating more as more terrible events occur more often. 
The Ai Slop that is being made in the political trash that causes the amount of uproar that can cause people to lose their lives in both a metaphorical and literal states.
The hope of the people to see that depiction can cause people to believe anything to where the ideas of morality can be perceived as twisted to people who don't agree with the ways people want others to see.
As it gets more advanced the idea that pornography is becoming more Ai is a lot more possible to become a kink for some men which would cause them to lose their connection with the world and place themselves in fantasy scenarios that could cause harm to them or other around them.
The Ai Slop can be seen as the new way to gain clickbait, how in the old days of YouTube they would use partially nude women as the thumbnails to gain more clicks and subscriptions.
With this new method of clickbait there is no need to make it sexualized but to make people angry enough to follow the misinformation then spread it to where people won’t know what’s real and cause more panic than is needed.
Ai slop can cause the problems in any environment and with events the people are experiencing the other people at are observing the problems won’t be able to see the problems with the clearest vision.
This new form of Ai is just the beginning of what can turn worse, because with the problems of not understanding the full truth behind any situation will cause the amount of misinformation will rise and countries and cultures will be over looked and their problems will grow to a point where conflict will be needed to survive in this new world.
With the content we have today the amount of cultural bias is so bad in Ai that the depiction of a perfect future is seen with mainly white people which is perceived as racist and problematic.
The feeling that Ai Slop has caused is known for bringing in more people into the problems with the wrong mindset and context to follow.
Hopefully with the new generation that will be educated with this new tool will be able to correct the problems we face when people make Ai Slop that people are making today.
